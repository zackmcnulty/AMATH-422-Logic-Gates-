# AMATH 422 - Computational Biology - CRIPSR NOR Gates

This project focused on replicating the results found in [an article](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15459?fbclid=IwAR3QN3lGy5qcakL6c9YztTK2aCRDt2xNNgvGr4DEvkVc4gzT6aV1TaBubF0) published by Gander et al. in *Nature Communications*.

The paper developed a two repressor system using CRISPR to create a high specificity NOR gate, improving
upon previous developments by vastly reducing the leakiness of the system.
